# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. It leverages machine learning to provide accurate estimates for potential homebuyers or sellers.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes real estate data points with information on square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding sale price of the house. This data is used to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

## Features
- **Square Footage :** The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms :** The number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Bathrooms :** The number of bathrooms in the house.

## Model Implementation
Implemented in Python using scikit-learn, the model applies the ordinary least squares method to learn the relationship between input features and the target variable, enabling accurate predictions on new data.

## How to Use
- **Data Preparation**: Structure your dataset with columns for square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and house prices.
- **Training**: Use the provided Python script to train the model on your dataset.
- **Prediction**: Predict house prices for new data points using the trained model.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy with metrics like MSE or RMSE.
